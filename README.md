## About

This App make use of ethers.js library, and gives us functionality that we can use either native currency of any Blockchain (BSC in our Case) or available tokens to buy any product.

With the help of APIs this app automatically convert price in US Dollar to BNB (native currency of BSC) and APIs are used to convert the price to any of the available tokens.

To send the tokens by using ethers we need those tokens' Contract Addresses and ABIs, so I just copied the Contract Addresses of various tokens and For ABI I just kept one common ABI for all tokens that have only Transfer function in it.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.

## Ethers library
The ethers.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. It was originally designed for use with ethers.io and has since expanded into a more general-purpose library.
